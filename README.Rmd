# containerit

`containerit` packages R script/session/workspace and all dependencies as a [Docker](http://docker.com/) container by automagically generating a suitable `Dockerfile`.
The packages's website at [https://o2r.info/containerit/](https://o2r.info/containerit/).
A good summary of what the package does can be found in this [o2r project blog post](http://o2r.info/2017/05/30/containerit-package/).

## Quick start

### Install

Development version from GitHub.

```
devtools::install_github("o2r-project/containerit")
```

### Use

See the vignettes at `vignettes/containerit.Rmd` for usage from the R command line, and `vignettes/container.Rmd` for the usage from a regular command line interface based on [containers from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/o2rproject/containerit/).

### Containers

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("here"))
dockerfile_latest <- readLines(here("inst/docker/Dockerfile"))
base_image = sub(".*? (.+)", "\\1", dockerfile_latest[[1]])
dockerfile_geospatial <- readLines(here("inst/docker/geospatial/Dockerfile"))
geospatial_base_image = sub(".*? (.+)", "\\1", dockerfile_geospatial[[1]])
```

Images are available starting from different base images.
All images are also available with version tags.

#### verse

Base image: `` `r base_image` ``

## Development

[r-hub builder](https://builder.r-hub.io/) is great for running checks, e.g. before submitting to CRAN and on other operating systems.

```{r checking, eval=FALSE}
library(rhub)
rhub::check_for_cran()
rhub::check_on_windows()
```

You can build the [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) site with

```{r pkgdown, eval=FALSE}
pkgdown::build_site()
```

You can build the Docker images locally with the current development version using the following commands.

```{bash dev_containers, eval=FALSE}
docker build --tag containerit:dev --file inst/docker/Dockerfile.local .
docker build --tag containerit:geospatial-dev --file inst/docker/geospatial/Dockerfile.local .
```

A [codemeta](https://codemeta.github.io/) file, `codemeta.json` with metadata about the package and its dependencies is generated automatically when this document is compiled.

```{r codemeta}
codemetar::write_codemeta("containerit")
```
